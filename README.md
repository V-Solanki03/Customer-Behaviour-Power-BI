# Customer Behaviour & Marketing Spend Optimization (Power BI)

## 📌 Business Problem
The objective of this project was to identify which customer behaviors generate profit and where marketing spend should be focused to maximize ROI.

## 📊 Dataset
- E-commerce / Superstore transactional dataset
- ~50,000+ records including sales, profit, discounts, and product categories

## 🧠 Approach
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used behaviour-based segmentation (Order Value Segment, Discount Sensitivity)
- Compared Sales vs Profit to identify high-ROI and loss-making behaviors
- Analyzed category-level performance across customer behavior segments

## 🔍 Key Insights
- High-value customer orders contribute the majority of total profit
- Discount-sensitive behavior increases sales but significantly reduces profitability
- Some product categories are only profitable at high order values

## ✅ Recommendations
- Focus marketing spend on high-value customer segments
- Reduce aggressive discounting strategies
- Promote profitable categories selectively based on customer behavior

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI
- Excel (data validation)
